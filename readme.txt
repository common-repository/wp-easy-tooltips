Simple plugin that allows you to easily add tooltips to your posts using a shortcode.

== Description ==

Really simple plugin that allows you to easily add tooltips to your posts using the shortcode [wpetp].

It was made for some simple tooltips with text and/or images. For example if you want a way to add some information about a word in your post without forcing the user to leave the page to see them.

Feel free to ask for some features if you think I missed some.

* Very first release.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

Uploading the Plugin : 
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

Creating a Tooltip :
1. Use the shortcode [wpetp title='the-placeholder' image='the-image-url']The text displayed in the tooltip.[/wpetp]

As you may have understood, the title is the text that once hovered will display the tooltip. The image attribute is an url to the image displayed in the tooltip, and finally, the text between the two tags is the text displayed in the tooltip.
